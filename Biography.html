								<h3>Hi there, </h3>
<p>My name is Petra Awad, I am an astronomer from Lebanon, currently based in the Netherlands. I am a postdoctoral scientist and developer for the Euclid telescope Near-Infrared (NIR) pipeline at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. As part of the Euclid science ground segment, my main job is to improve the processing of NIR images resulting in better quality data for the upcoming data releases. </p>
								<p>I attained my PhD degree at the University of Groningen where I graduated with cum laude distinction for my thesis titled "From the Large-Scale Structure to the Milky Way halo". My work was jointly conducted between the Kapteyn astronomical institute and the Bernoulli institute for mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Aside from my work in the Euclid Consortium, my research interests constitute the tracing of cosmic filaments within the Large-Scale Structure in both numerical simulations and observational surveys, as well as studying the properties of galaxies as a function of their cosmic environments. Other interests of mine include the characterization of the morphology and history of stellar streams within the Milky Way halo.</p>
					<p>Prior to my doctoral training, I attained my M.Sc in physics at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland with a thesis focused on probing compact dark matter objects using the microlensing signal from systems of strongly lensed quasars. Before that, I majored in physics for my B.Sc at the American University of Beirut (AUB) back home in Lebanon. There, I also attained minors in mathematics and computational science.</p>
					
					<p>Aside from my work, I enjoy cooking, learning new languages, progressive metal and rock, and reading any book I can get my hands on. Feel free to share your music preferences with me and don't be shy to ask for recommendations!</p>
